    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 17/01/2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing Camera Defect App ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we ("us," "our," or "we") collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our inspection camera application. The App is designed to function entirely offline, storing data on your device only, and does not transmit any personal or sensitive information to external servers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Camera Defect App. It explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the App. By using Camera Defect App, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Because Camera Defect App is built to operate locally on your device without sending data to external servers, we do not collect or store any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Information: This includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other identifying details.</li>
        <li>Location Data: We do not track or store your geographic location.</li>
        <li>Usage Analytics: We do not collect analytics or usage metrics of your interactions with the App.</li>
        <li>Device Identifiers: We do not collect any unique device IDs (e.g., IMEI, MAC address).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All inspection images, videos, notes, or other data captured or created using Camera Defect App are stored locally on your device. We do not access, transmit, or store this information on external servers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspection Data: Inspection images and videos are saved directly to your device's local storage. These files remain accessible only to you unless you choose to share them.</li>
        <li>Preferences and Settings: The App may store basic preference settings (e.g., camera settings, brightness, or language) on your device to provide a seamless user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use the Locally Stored Data</h2>
    <p>Since no data is transmitted off the device, any use of data remains under your direct control. The App uses locally stored data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Render and Display: Provide real-time camera preview and capture photos or videos for inspections.</li>
        <li>User Preferences: Remember your preferred camera settings and configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have access to your locally stored information. Any further sharing of your inspection data or images is initiated and controlled solely by you (for example, if you manually send files via email, messaging, or cloud storage).</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Camera Defect App does not integrate or rely on any third-party services that would transmit data. As such, no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks are used.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since Camera Defect App does not collect or store personal data, it does not distinguish between users based on age. However, if you are under the age of 13 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), please review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian to ensure understanding and compliance.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>Although the App does not transmit or store data outside your device, we encourage you to follow best security practices, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Securing your device with a password, PIN, or biometric protection.</li>
        <li>Keeping your operating system and software up to date.</li>
        <li>Avoiding the installation of untrusted apps that could access your local storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Since Camera Defect App does not collect personal data, we do not offer mechanisms for data deletion, rectification, or portability. All inspection data resides exclusively on your own device. You may remove the data by manually deleting your captured media or by uninstalling the App (which deletes all associated data from your device).</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this Policy. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically for any modifications. Your continued use of the App after the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>
